# 🧘‍♀️ Light-Bulb Moment

For any Hackathon, the most important and crucial part is to decide on a **idea**. In the initial stages of HoyaHacks we struggled on deciding on what topic or idea should we work on. Each and every member of our team had tons of ideas and the discord group chat was getting chaotic. Additionally, new members who joined later has issues with keeping up as they had to read the whole chat history. 

Thus, we decided to build a <img width="25" src="https://cdn3.iconfinder.com/data/icons/logos-and-brands-adobe/512/306_Slack-512.png" alt="Slack"/> Slack bot which can manage and maintain our ideas, so we can streamline and smoothen the whole process right from idea selection to deciding the features and actually implementing the project.

Also, this will be very helpful in corporate world where they teams are working on huge projects.

It's true that one can use other applications such as Notion or keep, but the issue with these applications is that after a certain time, the information stacked gets humongous and thus a new member of the team will not be able to digest that much information quickly. Also, for small hackathon projects, colaborating on multiple fronts is chaotic. As members will chat on slack and then refer notion or other application for notes. 

<p align="center"> | <b>HG-Bot</b> will solve all these issue and make our lives much easier. | </p>

# 🎮 Features

### 1. 🗃 Adding New Ideas

HG-Bot makes sure for every project idea:

- New idea is saved on Firebase - Realtime Database 
- Data stored in ordered fashion

### 2. ♻️ Edit/Delete existing ideas

Once ideas is organized into a HG-Bot firebase database, you can edit the ideas and even delete it. There are lots of moving parts for all the MLOps tooling and infrastructure you require for ML in production and ZenML aims to bring it all together under one roof.

### 3. 🧩 Display all the ideas

Any member of the group can get the list of ideas and all the features along with it with a single command.

<!-- ### 4. ☁ Visualize the Steps of your Pipeline -->

<!-- ### 5. 🧐 Visualize Statistics -->

<!-- Now you can use awesome third-party libraries to visualize ZenML steps and artifacts. We support the facets visualization for statistics out of the box, to find data drift between your training and test sets.

We use the built-in FacetStatisticsVisualizer using the [Facets Overview](https://pypi.org/project/facets-overview/) integration.

![Here’s what the statistics visualizer looks like](https://blog.zenml.io/assets/posts/release_0_5_3/stats.gif) -->

### 4. 📊 Vote your Ideas

We are also planning to introduce a feature that will allow group members to upvote or downvote a idea. This will help in narrowing down the ideas.

<!-- ### 5. 🛠 Configure Pipeline Runs with YAML Code -->
